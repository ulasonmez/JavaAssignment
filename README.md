# JavaAssignment
1) Write a public static method named displayArray, that takes two arguments. The first argument is an Array of int
and the second argument is a String. The method should print out a list of the values in the array, each separated by the
value of the second argument.
2) Write a public static method named getFirstItem, that takes an Array of double as an argument and returns the
value of the first element of the array.
3) Write a public static method named getLastItem, that takes an Array of double as an argument and returns the
value of the last element of the array.
4) Write a public static method named getAllButLast, that takes an Array of int as an argument and creates and
returns a new array with all of the values in the argument array except the last value.
5) Write a public static method named countLessThan, that takes two arguments. The first argument is an Array of
int, and the second argument is an int. This method will return (as an int) a count of the number of elements in the
argument array that are less than the value of the second argument.
6) Write a public static method named countBetween, that takes three arguments. The first argument is an Array of
int, the second and third arguments are both of type int (you can safely assume that the second argument value will
always be less than or equal to the third argument value). This method must return (as an int) a count of the number of
elements in the argument array that are greater than or equal to the second argument value, and less than or equal to
the value of the third argument.
7) Write a public static method named swapByIndex, that takes three arguments. The first argument is an Array of
double, and the second and third arguments are int indexes. This method will swap the values at the two given index
arguments in the array, and return a reference to the array. This method will not create a new Array. It will swap the
elements in the argument array and return the argument array.
8) Write a public static method named getLessThan, that takes two arguments. The first argument is an Array of int,
and the second argument is an int. This method create and return a new array with all of the values in the argument
array that are less than the second argument value. The order the values in the returned array must be the same as the
order of those values in the argument array.
9) Write a public static method named getBetween, that takes three arguments. The first argument is an Array of int,
the second and third arguments will be of type int (you can safely assume that the second argument value will always be
less than or equal to the third argument value). This method must create and return a new array with all of the values in
the argument array that are greater than or equal to the second argument value, and less than or equal to the value of
the third argument. The order the values in the returned array must be the same as the order of those values in the
argument array.
10) Write a public static method named isSorted, that takes an Array of int as an argument. This method should
return the boolean value true if all the element values in the array are in descending order (greatest to least); otherwise 
the method should return the boolean value false.
